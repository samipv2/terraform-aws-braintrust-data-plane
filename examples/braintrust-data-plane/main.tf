  ### Service Configuration
  # The maximum number of concurrent executions to reserve and constrain Braintrust lambdas to.
  # If you run Braintrust in a shared account you should set these to a reasonable limit to avoid
  # impacting other non-Braintrust Lambdas. AWS has a global shared limit of 1000 concurrent executions per account.
  # By default these are unlimited which is ideal for dedicated AWS account.
  # Recommended 100 to 1000 for production in a shared account.
  # api_handler_reserved_concurrent_executions = 100
  # ai_proxy_reserved_concurrent_executions    = 100

  # The number API Handler instances to provision and keep alive. This reduces cold start times and improves latency, with some increase in cost.

  ### Postgres configuration

  # postgres_storage_type                 = "gp3"

  # Storage IOPS for the RDS instance. Only applicable if storage_type is io1, io2, or gp3.
  # Recommended 15000 for production. Default for gp3 is 3000.
  # postgres_storage_iops                 = 10000

  # Throughput for the RDS instance. Only applicable if storage_type is gp3.

  # PostgreSQL engine version for the RDS instance.
  # postgres_version                      = "15"

  # Automatic upgrades of PostgreSQL minor engine version.
  # If true, AWS will automatically upgrade the minor version of the PostgreSQL engine for you.
  # Note: Don't include the minor version in your postgres_version if you want to use this.
  # If false, you will need to manually upgrade the minor version of the PostgreSQL engine.

  ### Redis configuration

  # Redis engine version
  # redis_version                         = "7.0"

  ### Network configuration
  # CIDR block for the VPC. You might need to adjust this so it does not conflict with any
  # other VPC CIDR blocks you intend to peer with Braintrust

  ### Braintrust Support
  # Enable sharing of Cloudwatch logs with Braintrust staff

  # Enable Bastion SSH access for Braintrust staff. This will create a bastion host and a security group that allows EC2 instance connect access from the Braintrust IAM Role.
