  ### Examples below are shown with the module defaults. You do not have to uncomment them
  ### unless you want to change the default value.
  ### The default values are for production-sized deployments.

  # This is primarily used for tagging and naming resources in your AWS account.
  # Do not change this after deployment. RDS and S3 resources can not be renamed.
  deployment_name = "braintrust"

  # Add your organization name from the Braintrust UI here
  braintrust_org_name = ""

  ### Postgres configuration
  # Changing this will incur a short downtime.
  postgres_instance_type = "db.r8g.2xlarge"

  # Initial storage size (in GB) for the RDS instance.
  postgres_storage_size = 1000
  # Maximum storage size (in GB) to allow the RDS instance to auto-scale to.
  postgres_max_storage_size = 10000

  # Storage type for the RDS instance. Recommended io2 for large production deployments.
  postgres_storage_type = "gp3"

  # Storage IOPS for the RDS instance. Only applicable if storage_type is io1, io2, or gp3.
  # Recommended 15000 for production.

  # Throughput for the RDS instance. Only applicable if storage_type is gp3.
  # Recommended 500 for production if you are using gp3. Leave blank for io1 or io2
  postgres_storage_throughput = 500

  # PostgreSQL engine version for the RDS instance.
  postgres_version = "15"

  # Automatic upgrades of PostgreSQL minor engine version.
  # If true, AWS will automatically upgrade the minor version of the PostgreSQL engine for you.
  # Note: Don't include the minor version in your postgres_version if you want to use this.
  # If false, you will need to manually upgrade the minor version of the PostgreSQL engine.
  postgres_auto_minor_version_upgrade = true

  # Multi-AZ RDS instance. Enabling increases cost but provides higher availability.
  # Recommended for critical production environments. Doubles the cost of the RDS instance.
  # postgres_multi_az                     = false

  ### Brainstore configuration
  # The license key for the Brainstore instance. You can get this from the Braintrust UI in Settings > API URL.

  # Recommended Graviton instance type with 16GB of memory

  # The number of dedicated Brainstore writer nodes to create
  # Recommended Graviton instance type with 32GB of memory

  ### Redis configuration

  # Default is acceptable for typical production deployments.
  redis_instance_type = "cache.t4g.medium"

  # Redis engine version
  redis_version = "7.0"


  ### Network configuration
  # WARNING: You should choose these values carefully after discussing with your networking team.
  # Changing them after the fact is not possible and will require a complete rebuild of your Braintrust deployment.

  # CIDR block for the VPC. The core Braintrust services will be deployed in this VPC.
  # You might need to adjust this so it does not conflict with any other VPC CIDR blocks you intend to peer with Braintrust.
  # vpc_cidr                             = "10.175.0.0/21"

  # CIDR block for the Quarantined VPC. This is used to run user defined functions in an isolated environment.
  # You might need to adjust this so it does not conflict with any other VPC CIDR blocks you intend to peer with Braintrust
  # quarantine_vpc_cidr                   = "10.175.8.0/21"


  ### Advanced configuration

  # The maximum number of concurrent executions to reserve and constrain Braintrust lambdas to.
  # If you run Braintrust in a dedicated account you can leave these at "-1" (unlimited).
  # If you run Braintrust in a shared account you should set these to a reasonable limit to avoid
  # impacting other non-Braintrust Lambdas. Recommended 100 to 1000 for production in a shared account.
  # api_handler_reserved_concurrent_executions = -1
  # ai_proxy_reserved_concurrent_executions    = -1

  # Uncomment these to set extra environment variables for the services.
  # Only use this when instructed to by the Braintrust team.

  ### Braintrust Remote Support

  # Enable sharing of Cloudwatch logs with Braintrust staff
  # enable_braintrust_support_logs_access = true

  # Enable Bastion SSH access for Braintrust staff. This will create a bastion host and a security group that allows EC2 instance connect access from the Braintrust IAM Role.
  # enable_braintrust_support_shell_access = true
