  ### Service Configuration
  # The maximum number of concurrent executions to reserve and constrain Braintrust lambdas to.
  # If you run Braintrust in a shared account you should set these to a reasonable limit to avoid
  # impacting other non-Braintrust Lambdas. AWS has a global shared limit of 1000 concurrent executions per account.
  # By default these are unlimited which is ideal for dedicated AWS account.
  # Recommended 100 to 1000 for production in a shared account.
  # api_handler_reserved_concurrent_executions = 100

  ### Postgres configuration

  ### Network configuration

  # other VPC CIDR blocks you intend to peer with Braintrust
  # vpc_cidr                             = "10.175.0.0/21"
